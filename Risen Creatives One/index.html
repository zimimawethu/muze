        <h1>ONE LOVE</h1>

        <h2>This is a call for the people of South Africa to come together against one enemy which is "DIFFERENCE".</h2>
        <p>The colours of the rainbow are different but they stand united for one common purpose, the trees in the forest are different but they also stand together for one common purpose. Therefore why do we people who called human beings, who share the same heart beat, the same smirky or unconstrained laughter and the salty tears when we are watching a chick-flick movie choose to focus on colour and ignore everything else that we identically share as human beings.</p>
        <h1>IT IS NATURALLY AND HIGHLY POSSIBLE!</h1>
        <h3>Join the call, let love dwell amongst us once again.</h3>
        <p>It doesn't take a village to restore humanity, it takes only one smile at a time followed by a confident "Hello".</p>
        <p>Don't be afraid to shake that person's hand and to start that random awkward conversation.</p>
